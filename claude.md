# Samuel Bunker Portfolio Website - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
A React-based portfolio website showcasing Samuel Bunker's web development and graphic design work WITH A HIP-HOP TWIST.

## Project Goals
- Learn React while building a practical, real-world application
- Create a BOLD portfolio that showcases technical skills, creative expression, AND personality
- Integrate hip-hop aesthetic with professional web development
- Implement modern UI/UX best practices while maintaining street-level authenticity
- Balance gangster-rap vibes with accessibility and performance standards

## Design Philosophy - THE REVISION 🔥

### Visual Style - Hip-Hop Meets Code
- **BOLD, GANGSTER-RAP AESTHETIC** with boom-bap soul
- Pages styled as "RAP SHEETS" - wrinkled paper edges, torn corners, notebook aesthetic
- Terminal/code editor vibes mixed with freestyle rap energy
- Lyrical section intros - rhymes introducing each section
- **Show off talent beautifully** - bold, confident, street-smart
- Balance between technical professionalism and hip-hop culture

### The Hip-Hop Integration
**About Samuel:**
- Huge hip-hop head (Eminem, J-Cole, Joyner Lucas, Ice Cube, D12)
- Loves boom-bap beats (snare + bass hits)
- Freestyler and rap enthusiast
- Hands-on learner fascinated by technology
- Loves the gangster-rap vibe and style

**Design Approach:**
- Pages look like "rap sheets" or lyric notebooks
- Wrinkled, torn paper edges on sections
- Section headers introduced with rhymes/bars
- Code blocks styled like verses
- Projects presented like album releases or mixtapes
- Skills section = "The Arsenal" or "Tools of the Trade"

### Color Palette - Street Smart & Accessible

Based on UI/UX research, WCAG 2.2 accessibility guidelines, AND hip-hop aesthetics:

#### Primary Colors
1. **Sky Blue** (The Cool Brand)
   - Light: `#87CEEB` - Soft sky blue for backgrounds
   - Medium: `#4A90E2` - Interactive elements, links (like graffiti blue)
   - Dark: `#2E5C8A` - Text on light backgrounds
   - Vibe: Cool, chill, smooth like a J-Cole beat

2. **Pure Black** `#000000` (The Ink)
   - Usage: Primary text, BOLD headings, lyrics/rhymes
   - Rap sheet ink, terminal text, code
   - Strong contrast = readability on point

3. **Cream/Off-White** `#FFFEF0` or `#F5F5DC` (Notebook Paper)
   - Main background color (aged paper aesthetic)
   - Worn notebook pages where bars are written
   - Warmer than pure white, vintage feel

4. **Pure White** `#FFFFFF` (Clean Sheets)
   - Code blocks, modern sections
   - Negative space, contrast cards

#### Accent/Street Colors
5. **Warm Gold** `#FFA834` (The Bling)
   - Highlights, achievements, badges
   - Hover states on links
   - "Gold record" accomplishments
   - CTAs that pop like jewelry

6. **Deep Red/Burgundy** `#8B0000` or `#A52A2A` (Used Sparingly!)
   - Danger/error states only
   - Subtle accent on "fire" projects
   - Used minimally to avoid overwhelming

7. **Graffiti Gray Tones**
   - Light Gray: `#D3D3D3` - Paper texture, subtle shadows
   - Medium Gray: `#808080` - Secondary text, faded ink
   - Dark Gray: `#2F2F2F` - Charcoal, used in dark mode

#### Paper/Texture Effects
- **Wrinkled paper texture:** CSS box-shadow + border effects
- **Torn edges:** SVG clip-paths or border images
- **Notebook lines:** Subtle horizontal rules (very faint blue lines)
- **Ink splatters:** Small decorative elements (optional)
- **Pencil sketches:** Rough border styles for rap sheet sections

#### Code Terminal Styling
- Terminal background: `#1E1E1E` (dark gray, not pure black)
- Terminal text: `#00FF00` (classic green) or sky blue
- Syntax highlighting maintains VSCode theme
- Mix terminal aesthetic with lyric sheet vibes

#### Accessibility Notes
- All text/background combinations maintain WCAG 2.2 AA (4.5:1 minimum)
- Paper texture doesn't interfere with text readability
- Color isn't sole indicator (icons + text)
- Dark mode flips to dark paper with light ink
